# About the project :
A question & answering system using T5 Transformer (Hugging Face) and Pytorch Lightning. Here used Bio-Medical Dataset to train the model and predicting the answer from question.

1. Used Pytorch Lightning for creating DataSet, DataLoader and DataModule in the custom DataFrame.

2. Used T5 TokenizerFast for creating Embeddings Vector and model inputs.

3. Used T5 Transformers for training purpose and make prediction using the trained model to the given text input.
